Contributing to openATTIC
=========================

As an open source project, we encourage and appreciate any kind of
contributions like comments, enhancement requests, bug reports, or code
contributions!

Getting involved
----------------

You can get in touch with the developers via our public "openATTIC Users"
discussion group on Google Groups at
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openattic-users>.

You can subscribe to it via the web page, or via email, by sending an empty
message to openattic-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com, using the email address
that you want to use to exchange messages with this group (no Google account
required).

You can also find us on IRC - visit the #openattic channel on irc.freenode.net
to chat with the developers.

Reporting Bugs or Enhancement Requests
--------------------------------------

In order to facilitate the submission of enhancement requests, bug reports or
patch contributions, we have set up a public issue tracking system based on
Atlassian Jira at <http://tracker.openattic.org>. You can sign up for an
account by various means. Using real names is preferred.

Submitting Patches
------------------

The openATTIC source code is managed using the Mercurial distributed source
control management tool <https://www.mercurial-scm.org/>. The code repository
is publicly hosted on BitBucket <https://bitbucket.org/openattic/openattic/>.

This project tracks patch provenance and licensing using the Developer
Certificate of Origin and Signed-off-by tags initially developed by the Linux
kernel project.

See the chapter "Developer Documentation" in the official reference
documentation at <http://docs.openattic.org> for details on the patch
contribution process and workflow.
