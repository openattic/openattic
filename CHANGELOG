[2.0.9] - 2016-03-16
--------------------

Added
~~~~~
* Installation: The Nagios plugins now read
  ``/etc/(default|sysconfig)/openattic``to obtain distribution-specific
  configuration options (esp. path names). This makes them more portable across

  the patch)
* Installation: The Nagios plugins now use the distribution's default
  directory ``/var/lib/nagios`` on EL7 to store runtime information (as
  configured via the setting ``NAGIOS_STATE_DIR`` in
  ``/etc/(default|sysconfig)/openattic``) instead of ``/var/lib/nagios3``
  (which is the default in Debian). Removed directory ``/var/lib/nagios3``
  from the ``openattic-module-nagios`` RPM package.
* Documentation: Restructured and refined the installation instructions

Fixed
~~~~~
* Installation: Fixed error in ``oaconfig install`` that resulted in an
  incomplete installation ("This command requires oacli to be

  Nagios plugins actually work on EL7 (OP-976, OP-977)

Removed
~~~~~~~

  wasn't portable and package installation should rather be performed by
  the dedicated OS tools (e.g. ``apt-get`` or ``yum``) (OP-659)
